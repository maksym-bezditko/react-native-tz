## Documentation for the project:

#### Notice:

Thanks for the interesting idea, it was a pleasure to work on this as well as on the API project. I have completed all project requirements as required.

_I will add a screencast to the zipped folder, so you can visually see how the app works, just in case you fail to launch it for any reason._

#### How to launch the project:

1.  Make sure to navigate to the root folder of the project
2.  If node is not installed on your machine, please make sure to do it. Here is the guide: [https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/how-to-install-nodejs/](https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/how-to-install-nodejs/)
3.  Run `npm run init-and-start-ios` command in the terminal in order to run the app on an iOS emulator
4.  Run `npm run init-and-start-android` command in the terminal in order to run the app on an Android emulator
5.  The app should be built successfully and the emulator window will be shown.

#### Project structure description:

*   We have `helpers`, `modules`, `components`, `hooks`, `store`, `theme`, `typings` folders at the top level of the `src` folder. Â Their names are self-explanatory. Just need to mention that all the content from them is used throughout the whole project. That is why it is at the top level.
